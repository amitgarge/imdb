# IMDb-Internet Movie Database

IMDb is an online database of information related to world films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings.

In this web Application, The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API is used, which is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images, and display the information using html elements.

Using the OMDb API, we can search the movie details in two ways:
	1. By title (and released year, which is optional)
	2. By ID (IMDb ID)

On the index.html page of this app, you can enter the title with or without released year.
					OR
You can search by a valid IMDb ID (e.g. tt1285016).

After searching it will display the information accordingly.
